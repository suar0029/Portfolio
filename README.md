This Project was challeging because it is the biggest project so far to build, besides that it took me a while and to be honest I feel that I still need to work and improve my skills in coding even though I tried to do my best (I would like to add this was not the only assignment that I had for this week, I feel like my body is standing but me just got lost). On the other hand I feel that IÂ´ve been rushing a lot to send this and I just wish I could have done better, coding for me is still hard; even though I believed that with bootstrap techniche is a lot easier and I could acomplish.
